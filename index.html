									<h3>Lynch: Orion constellation story of love, loss, scorpions</h3>
									My favourite tale trickles down from Greek and Roman mythology and involves Artemis, the goddess of the moon. Orion the Hunter was a real man's man. He also was a rather shy giant who didn't like to mix with other people, so he moved to a large but deserted island where he could hunt and fish to his heart's content. He was big and burly and he lived for hunting and fishing. Like most of the animals he was after, Orion was nocturnal. He stalked and hunted by night and slept under a giant tree by day. He never had to see or hear about the Kardashians.

Life was great for Orion. The hermit hunter was living his dream. Every night he was out there slaying beasts of all kinds.<br>
He also had a secret admirer â€” Artemis, the great moon goddess. Every night Artemis guided her moon chariot with magical flying horses. Artemis wanted to jump down and be with her unsuspecting lover, but she held back because she knew that would get her in a lot of trouble with her father Zeus, the king of the gods. Artemis would be ignoring her duties as moon goddess, but much worse than that, it was a big no-no for gods and goddesses to be mixing with mortals. Zeus greatly frowned on this!

So there she was, stranded in the sky night after night with the moon and those silly flying horses, being denied the company of Orion. One night as Orion was cleaning up on a whole herd of wild boars, Artemis couldn't take it anymore. She headed on down to Orion's island and met him eye-to-eye and toe-to-toe. It was love at first sight. Orion quickly gave up on the hermit thing after one look at the goddess. Right away she changed out her royal robes and put on hunter's blaze orange. She hunted with him the rest of the night, but when dawn approached she jumped back up to the moon chariot and raced it to the horizon. The next night she halted the moon in mid-sky again and joined her new love for another night of hunting, jumping back on her chariot at dawn.

This hunting love affair went on night after night.<br>

 Orion and Artemis were very much in love. Rules were rules though, and eventually Zeus found out about his daughter's behavior through the godly grapevine. He had to stop this affair, but as ruthless as his reputation was, he didn't want to lose the love of his daughter. So Zeus hatched a scheme. Zeus arranged to have Orion killed during the day and make it look like an accident. He made arrangements for a giant scorpion to be dropped on Orion's island and fatally sting the hunter in his sleep, eliminating his daughter's temptation.

The day of Orion's planned scorpion demise arrived.<br>
<Strong>
 As Orion slept off </strong>
 another night of successful hunting with his divine girlfriend, the steroid enhanced scorpion crawled into his camp. Nobody knew it, but Orion had a security system. His buddy, a loud mockingbird, sounded the alarm. Orion bolted up as the Scorpion attacked. What followed was a battle that went on for hours. As evening set in, the hunter had the scorpion in a headlock and had just about broken its neck. Just then Orion was distracted as he saw Artemis rising with the moon in the east. The scorpion, down to its last gasp, managed to break out of the hunter's hold and sting Orion's neck. In a few minutes it was all over for our hunter.

Artemis raced to the scene but she was too late. Her boyfriend was a goner. As the killer scorpion made its retreat, the moon goddess grabbed it by the tail and flung it so far into the sky that it became the constellation Scorpius the Scorpion. Artemis then returned to the slain Orion and wept over him for hours and hours. Finally she cradled his body into her arms and flew off to the sky. When she was high enough she gently tossed Orion a little higher in the sky, turning him into a bright constellation. She made sure that Orion was on the opposite side of the sky from the scorpion that assassinated him. That's why we never see the constellations Orion and Scorpius in the sky at the same time.
